abstract = "Combining strong signal amplification made possible by Gaseous Electron Multipliers (GEMs) with the high spatial resolution provided by optical readout, highly performing radiation detectors can be realized. An optically read out GEM-based Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is presented. The device permits 3D track reconstruction by combining the 2D projections obtained with a CCD camera with timing information from a photomultiplier tube. Owing to the intuitive 2D representation of the tracks in the images and to automated control, data acquisition and event reconstruction algorithms, the optically read out TPC permits live display of reconstructed tracks in three dimensions. An Ar/CF4 (80/20%) gas mixture was used to maximize scintillation yield in the visible wavelength region matching the quantum efficiency of the camera. The device is integrated in a UHV-grade vessel allowing for precise control of the gas composition and purity. Long term studies in sealed mode operation revealed a minor decrease in the scintillation light intensity."

abstract = "A gas-filled Time Projection Chamber and a radioactive neutron source were used to study recoil tracks produced by scattering of the multi-MeV neutrons on gas nuclei. Since the event readout is triggered by the first electron arrival, the initial time and position in the electron drift direction are unknown, leading to a translational uncertainty in this direction. By using the track width due to electron diffusion, the coordinate along the drift direction was determined. With a suitable width calibration at a known drift distance, it is found that width measurements of the track can provide useful information for establishing a well-defined gas fiducial volume for the interactions. The coordinate determination is also sufficiently precise that it can be used as a third parameter in kinematic reconstruction of the neutron collision, providing improved knowledge of the neutron collision process. Despite a wide range of track ionization levels resulting from the broad spectrum of neutron energies and varying angles of scatter, the coordinate determination is not sensitive to the track ionization."

In a volume of 2000 m3 of CF4 at normal pressure and room temperature, which corresponds to a mass of 7.4 ton, we expect ~ 3300 of such events per year. The detector can give the spectrum of the low energy neutrinos from the Sun and it can identify solar neutrinos of different origin: pp, 7Be, and, eventually, 8B. We find that 14C is a possible severe source of background: it is necessary to have a ratio 14C/12C lower than 10−19 in order to be able to identify the pp neutrinos."

Proposed applications for low-energy and rare event studies, such as Dark Matter search, ask for demanding performance in the keV energy range. The performance of such a readout was studied in details as a function of the electric field configuration and GEM gain by using a 55Fe source within a 7 litre sensitive volume detector developed as a part of the R&D for the CYGNUS project. Results reported in this paper show that the low noise level of the sensor allows to operate with a 2 keV threshold while keeping a rate of fake-events lesser than 10 per year. In this configuration, a detection efficiency well above 95% along with an energy resolution (σ) of 18%  is obtained for the 5.9 keV photons  demonstrating the very promising capabilities of this technique.}

	title = {{FITPix} {\textemdash} fast interface for Timepix pixel detectors},
	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix contains an array of 256  ×  256 square pixels with pitch 55 μm. In addition to high spatial granularity the single quantum counting detector Timepix can provide also energy or time information in each pixel. This device is a powerful tool for radiation and particle detection, imaging and tracking. A new readout interface for silicon pixel detectors of the Medipix family has been developed in our group in order to provide a higher frame rate and enhanced flexibility of operation. The interface consists of a field programmable gate array, a USB 2.0 interface chip, DAC, ADC and a circuit which generates bias voltage for the sensor. The main control system is 
placed in the FPGA circuit which fully controls the Timepix device. This 
approach offers an easy way how to include new functionality and extended 
operation. The interface for Timepix supports all operation modes of the 
detector (counting, TOT, timing). The FITPix is a successor of the USB 1.22 
Interface and the electronic readout is built with the latest available 
components, which allows achieving up to 90 frames per second with a single 
detector. The frame rate is about 20 times faster compared to the previous 
system while it maintains all same capabilities supported. In addition 
FITPix newly enables an adjustable clock frequency and hardware triggering 
which is a useful tool when there is the need for synchronized operation of 
multiple devices. Three modes of hardware trigger have been implemented: 
hardware trigger which starts the measurement, hardware trigger which 
terminates the measurement and hardware trigger which controls measurement 
fully. The entire system is fully powered through the USB bus. FITPix 
supports also readout from several detectors in chain in which case just an 
external power source is required. FITPix is a fully flexible device and the 
user needs no other equipment. FITPix combines high performance and mobility 
and it opens new fields of applications. The current version of the FITPix 
interface has dimension 45 mm  ×  60 mm.}

This gas has recently received attention   in the context of directional Dark Matter searches, thanks to its   high Fluorine content, reduced diffusion and multiple species of   charge carriers, which allow for full detector fiducialization. Our   measurements, performed with a 5 cm drift distance Negative Ion Time   Projection Chamber, show the possibility of negative ion operation   in pure SF6 between 75 and 150 Torr with triple thin GEM   amplification, confirming the attractive potentialities of this   gas. Above all, our results with the mixture He:CF4:SF6 360:240:10 Torr demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of   SF6− negative ion drift and gas gain in He at nearly   atmospheric pressure, opening very interesting prospects for the   next generation of directional Dark Matter detectors.}

	abstract = {The ATLAS New Small Wheels will be the first major upgrade   to an LHC experiment utilizing the Micromegas technology. With an   active detection area of 1280 m2 and comprising more than two   million channels it is the largest and probably most ambitious   system of Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) currently under   construction.    The eponymous component of the Micromegas technology, the micromesh,   is the detector's most precise component. Although a wide range of   meshes, mesh geometries and parameters can be used to build an   operational Micromegas, its properties can affect a range of   detector qualities, such as reconstruction efficiency, timing and   energy resolution. Conversely, the correct choice of this component   will permit a wider range in operation parameters and optimize the   detector performance.}

We report on measurements of total light yields in Ar/CF4, He/CF4, Ar/TEA and Xe/TEA mixtures. Information on the energy resolution obtained with low-energy X-ray photons is also presented. The spectral distribution of the light produced in the GEM is analysed and the mechanisms associated with the process of light production are considered."
